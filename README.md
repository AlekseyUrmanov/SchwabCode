Just a bunch of files and code I once used. 
Everything is written by me and is used to analyze data or place trades on Charles Schwab exchnage. 
API keys are expired feel free to steal them.

I make new files and functions everyday on my laptop; sometimes I upload them to have a backup source incase my laptop bricks. 

Some stuff is interesting, some of it, not so much.
